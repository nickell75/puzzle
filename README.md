Hopscotch coding challenge

Create a 15 puzzle UI using javascript (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). The user should
be able to move blocks into the blank space to try and solve the puzzle. It should behave like a
physical puzzle in that you can push an entire row over into the blank space. (i.e. in the example
below, you could push all of row 1 over from the 15 square).
